# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

I feel quite exited about this course, but I am also afraid that the workload for me will be too much since I have absolutely no prior experience on R or other programming languages, and I have a quite crowded calender even without this course. I hope I will make it!
